# Movie Demo

This repository contains the code for the movie coding challenge issued by Square6. The functions of this application include the ability to view the latest popular films of the day by genre and to select a specific film and view more information about the film.

## Getting Started

For this project, you will require a development environment that handles Xamarin projects. Check out the following link if you require more information on how to accomplish this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/installation/windows 

Also, to properly build for both iOS and Android, you will require either an Apple device and/or Mac build host (iOS) and either an Android device and/or Android emulators (Android) which you can setup on Visual Studio itself. 

For more information on how to accomplish either of these tasks, check out the following links:
